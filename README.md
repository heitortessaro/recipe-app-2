# Recipe App 2

The Recipe App 2 is a new version of a previously developed project. The code developed before is used as a starting point for this project. The objective is to use Tailwind and DaisyUI to build the UI design. Other difference is the use of the Reduc Tool kit in this project. 

Here is the [link]([https://github.com/heitortessaro/TriviaGame](https://github.com/heitortessaro/recipe-app)) to the previous version.

# The Project

The user can see, search, filter, favorite and follow the progress of preparation of recipes and drinks! 

Two different APIs are used, one for food and one for drinks. [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) is an open, community-maintained database of recipes and ingredients from around the world. The [CockTailDB](https://cocktaildb.com/) API is very similar (even maintained by the same entity) to TheMealDB API, only focused on drinks.

The layout focuses on mobile devices, so all prototypes will be developed on smaller screens.

Recipe App 2 will use the following techs:
- React
- ReduxTolkit
- Hooks
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI
